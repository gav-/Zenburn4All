# Zenburn4All
A collection of Zenburn themes for multiple applications.

This collection is developed on the Linux Mint 17.3 MATE distribution. The suitability of the collected themes for other
distributions may vary.

A work in progress GTK2/GTK3 desktop theme designed to match well with Zenburn (as seen in the screenshots) is here: [Clearlooks Phenix Dark](https://github.com/gav-/Clearlooks-Phenix-Dark).
